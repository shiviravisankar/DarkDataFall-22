            The rise in technological management of workers’ time, with a focus on productivity monitoring, is novel only in how widespread and unrelenting it has become. Across industries and income brackets, workers are increasingly being subjected to digital surveillance and tracking. The spike in remote forms of work during the pandemic changed how workplace supervision and evaluation could operate. Employers increasingly turned to technological techniques that could achieve a level of intrusion and monitoring that human managers were incapable of mimicking. But the phenomenon of worker surveillance is not a modern technological innovation. Apart from managerial forms of supervision, labor measurement has been quantified by the clock since the eighteenth century. The notion of clocked time as a proxy for work output is entwined with histories of labor, exploitation, colonization, and conquest. Labor extraction remains a common basis for the relationship between time and capitalism, even as technology allows it to take different forms in the contemporary period.

            Time is a notoriously difficult concept to sensorially grasp. Due to its surreal qualities, what counts as <q>time</q>, and how it is defined or measured are semiotically mediated concerns. Our linguistic scaffolding, which is to say, the language we use shapes how we think, interpret or judge our sense of time. <b>Time is then neither politically neutral nor <q>timeless</q>.</b> Our relationship to time—the experience of accurate measurement and profitable use of time—is a historically constructed one, intertwined with the milieu of industrial capitalism as well as the racially-charged legacy of colonialism.

            Our apprehension of time is technologically conditioned by the development of increasingly accurate timepieces that apart from regulating the rhythms of industrial life, acted as a means of labor exploitation. The core impulse of workplace supervision recalls plantation logic in the drive to seek control over the bodies that form the workforce. One cannot forget that business procedures and workplace techniques were developed by and for large plantations. The enforcement of work-discipline took on a temporal register in the industrial setting with clock time establishing punctuality and attendance as mechanisms to maximize the output extracted
