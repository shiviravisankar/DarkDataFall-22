            According to a 2019 research conducted by Thorn (International Anti Human Trafficking Foundation) “40% of kids aged 13-17” agreed that it was normal to share nudes amongst peers and 1 in 5 girls of the same age group agreed to have shared nudes. This data is most likely underrepresented considering the sensitivity around the subject.

            While this data might frighten you into scrutinizing your child about whether or not they participate in such activities, we must take a step back and consider ¿What is the actual problem? Is it wrong that children are deciding to explore their sexual identities online or have adults been irresponsibly moving towards “innovation”? Are we questioning the ethics behind these tech companies' economic models? And how should we go about perceiving sexuality and nudity amongst the new generation?  While individual caution is always required, in a world where Self-generated child sexual abuse material (SG-CSAM) is rapidly growing there needs to be a re-evaluation of attention-based economic incentives within major Social Media Platforms to effectively protect our children.
